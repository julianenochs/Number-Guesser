# Number Guesser

The goal of the number guesser project is to recreate a web game app based on a comp that allows two users to play a game of guessing a randomly generated number based on a minimum and maximum input from the users.

### Game Play

After users decide on the range, the enter their names and guesses into the challenger names and guesses input fields and click "Submit" to submit their guesses.

If a guess is too high, the users are prompted with a "This guess is too high" message. If a guess is too low, users are prompted with a "This guess is too low message". If a winner guesses the number correctly, "Boom!"" appears and a card generates on the right half of the app with both challenger names and the winner's name being displayed prominently on the card.
